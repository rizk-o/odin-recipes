# odin-recipes

In this project, I built a simple website sharing 3 amazing recipes I found on the internet. The goal of this project was to practice my HTML chops and better familiarize myself with the git workflow. The website does not look good, but I'll be revisiting it to add some style as I progress through The Odin Project curriculum.
