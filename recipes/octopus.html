        <p>Grilling octopus brings out its distinct, tender chewiness and mild, delicate taste. Learn how to make grilled octopus at home.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>3 rosemary sprigs</li>
            <li>10 whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
            <li>5 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
            <li>3 lemons, divided</li>
            <li>1 3-pound octopus, cleaned, beak and eyes removed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley, tarragon, and dill, to garnish</li>
            <li>Flaky salt, to garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with water and add the bay leaves, rosemary, peppercorns, 1 teaspoon of the salt, the garlic cloves, and 1 lemon, halved.</li>
            <li>Bring the braising liquid to a boil.

            </li>
            <li>Add the octopus to the boiling water and lower the heat to a simmer, cooking until the octopus is tender, approximately 45 minutes. (Test the meat’s tenderness by piercing it with a sharp knife.)

            </li>
            <li>Using tongs, remove the octopus from the braising liquid and cut it into large pieces. Set the octopus aside to cool.

            </li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the olive oil, black pepper, and the juice of 1 lemon.

            </li>
            <li>Add the cooled octopus to the marinade, cover, and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.

            </li>
            <li>Start a charcoal or wood fire, or preheat your gas grill to high heat.

            </li>
            <li>Grill the octopus pieces until their exterior browns, but they’re still juicy inside, approximately 3–4 minutes per side.

            </li>
            <li>Remove the octopus pieces from the grill quickly, so they don’t overcook.

            </li>
            <li>Slice the remaining lemon into wedges and serve alongside the octopus.

            </li>
            <li>Garnish the grilled octopus with fresh herbs and flaky salt.
